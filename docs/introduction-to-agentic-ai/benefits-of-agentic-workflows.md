# Benefits of Agentic Workflows

## Introduction

This page explores the key benefits of agentic workflows. If you're new to agentic AI, start with [What is Agentic AI?](what-is-agentic-ai.md) to understand the foundational concepts.

Agentic workflows provide several key advantages over traditional single-prompt LLM approaches. Understanding these benefits helps explain why agentic workflows are becoming the preferred approach for building sophisticated AI applications.

## Enabling Previously Impossible Tasks

The primary benefit of agentic workflows is that they enable many tasks that were previously not feasible with traditional LLM approaches. By breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, combining multiple tools, and allowing iterative refinement, agentic workflows unlock capabilities that go far beyond single-prompt interactions.

## Significant Performance Improvements

Agentic workflows deliver substantial performance improvements, often exceeding the gains from upgrading to newer model generations.

### Performance Benchmark: Human Eval

Research on coding benchmarks illustrates this clearly. Using the Human Eval benchmark—which tests LLMs' ability to write code to accomplish specific tasks—reveals dramatic differences:

- **GPT-3.5** (non-agentic): Achieves approximately 40% accuracy when asked to write code directly
- **GPT-4** (non-agentic): Improves to 67% accuracy—a significant leap in performance
- **GPT-3.5** (agentic workflow): With agentic techniques like reflection and iterative improvement, GPT-3.5 can achieve much higher performance levels
- **GPT-4** (agentic workflow): GPT-4 also shows substantial improvements when used within an agentic workflow

The improvement from implementing an agentic workflow on GPT-3.5 can be larger than the improvement from upgrading from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4. This demonstrates that workflow design can be as important as model selection in achieving high performance.

## Parallelism: Accelerating Sequential Tasks

Agentic workflows can parallelize tasks that humans must perform sequentially, enabling faster completion of complex work.

### Example: Parallel Web Research

Consider an agentic workflow tasked with writing an essay about black holes:

1. **Parallel Search Term Generation**: Three LLMs run in parallel to generate different sets of web search queries
2. **Parallel Web Searches**: Multiple web searches execute simultaneously
3. **Parallel Content Retrieval**: Based on search results, multiple web pages are identified for fetching
4. **Parallel Downloads**: All identified web pages (e.g., nine pages) download simultaneously
5. **Synthesis**: The LLM processes all retrieved content to write the final essay

While a human researcher would need to read and process these web pages sequentially, the agentic workflow downloads and processes them in parallel. This parallelization can make agentic workflows faster than human-performed sequential research, even though agentic workflows take longer than single-prompt approaches.

## Modularity: Combining Best Components

Agentic workflows are inherently modular, allowing you to combine the best components from different sources to build effective systems.

### Swapping and Upgrading Components

The modular design enables several powerful capabilities:

- **Tool Replacement**: Swap out components like web search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Perplexity, etc.) to find the best fit for your use case
- **Tool Addition**: Add new capabilities—for example, replacing a web search step with a news search engine to find the latest breakthroughs on a topic
- **Model Selection**: Use different LLMs for different steps of the workflow, optimizing each component for its specific task
- **Provider Flexibility**: Try different LLM providers to see which performs best for specific steps in your system

This modularity allows continuous refinement and optimization of workflows without rebuilding entire systems from scratch.

## Summary

Agentic workflows provide four key benefits:

1. **Capability Expansion**: Enable tasks that weren't possible with traditional approaches
2. **Performance Gains**: Achieve significant improvements that can exceed model upgrades
3. **Parallelism**: Execute tasks in parallel that humans must perform sequentially
4. **Modularity**: Combine and optimize components from different sources efficiently

These benefits make agentic workflows a powerful approach for building sophisticated AI applications that can tackle complex, real-world problems.
