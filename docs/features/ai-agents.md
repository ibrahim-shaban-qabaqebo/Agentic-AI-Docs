# AI Agents

Agentic AI provides powerful autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks and make intelligent decisions.

## Overview

AI Agents are autonomous systems that can:
- Understand context and goals
- Break down complex tasks
- Make decisions based on available information
- Execute actions and iterate based on results

## Creating an Agent

```python
from agentic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="research-assistant",
    instructions="You are a research assistant specialized in finding and summarizing information.",
    model="gpt-4"
)
```

## Agent Capabilities

### Task Execution

```python
result = agent.run("Find the latest research on quantum computing")
print(result.output)
```

### Multi-Step Tasks

```python
result = agent.run(
    "Research the top 3 AI frameworks, compare their features, and create a summary"
)
```

### Tool Usage

```python
from agentic_ai.tools import WebSearch, Calculator

agent = Agent(
    name="researcher",
    tools=[WebSearch(), Calculator()]
)

result = agent.run("Search for Python tutorials and calculate the average duration")
```

## Agent Types

### Research Agent

Specialized in gathering and analyzing information:

```python
from agentic_ai.agents import ResearchAgent

agent = ResearchAgent()
result = agent.research("climate change impacts")
```

### Code Agent

Helpful for programming tasks:

```python
from agentic_ai.agents import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent()
result = agent.generate_code("Create a REST API in Python")
```

### Analysis Agent

For data analysis and insights:

```python
from agentic_ai.agents import AnalysisAgent

agent = AnalysisAgent()
result = agent.analyze(data, "Find trends and anomalies")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, detailed instructions
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Use feedback loops to improve results
3. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate tools for your use case
4. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully

## Examples

See [Basic Examples](../examples/basic.md) and [Advanced Examples](../examples/advanced.md) for more use cases.
