# Agentic AI Documentation

A comprehensive guide to understanding, designing, and implementing modern agentic AI systems. This documentation covers theoretical foundations, architectural patterns, and practical implementations for building powerful agentic workflows.

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift from traditional single-prompt LLM interactions to multi-step, iterative workflows. Instead of asking an AI to complete a task in one pass, agentic workflows break down complex problems into manageable steps, enabling:

- **Iterative refinement**: Improving outputs through multiple passes
- **External tool integration**: Accessing web search, databases, APIs, and other resources
- **Strategic planning**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Quality assurance**: Reviewing and validating outputs before completion

## Documentation Features

- 🎨 Modern Material Design theme inspired by Pydantic AI
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🔍 Built-in search functionality
- 🌓 Dark/Light mode toggle
- ⚡ Fast page loads
- 📚 Comprehensive coverage of agentic AI concepts
- 🚀 Real-world examples and case studies

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-minify-plugin
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Building

Build the static site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

The site will be generated in the `site/` directory.

## Deployment

This documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` or `master` branch.

### Manual Deployment

1. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: GitHub Actions

2. Push to trigger deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation"
git push origin main
```

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `docs/` directory with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings in your domain provider
3. Update `site_url` in `mkdocs.yml`
